# INSAID-DLF_Jigna-Thacker
Deep Learning Foundation Project on Seattle Weather Data  - INSAID GCDAI program

As a part of GCDAI- Deep Learning Foundation Term Project, INSAID : 
  I have taken Seattle Rain database to Predict rain on the specific day.

### Project Brief:
- Content 
    - Besides coffee, grunge and technology companies, one of the things that Seattle is most famous for is how often it rains. This dataset contains complete records of daily       rainfall patterns from January 1st, 1948 to December 12, 2017. The data is present in a single csv file: seattle_weather.csv - Dataset consisting of approximately 25,551       data samples.
- Data Description: 
    - DATE : The date of the observation
    - PRCP : The amount of precipitation, in inches
    - TMAX : The maximum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit
    - TMIN : The minimum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit
    - RAIN : TRUE if rain was observed on that day, FALSE if it was not. [target variable]
- Objective: 
    - This dataset is intended for binary classification tasks. 
    - Use this data set to build a model able to predict whether it will rain on a specific day.
